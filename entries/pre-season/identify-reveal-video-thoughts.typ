Today marks the beginning of the VRC High Stakes season. 53D had an online watch party to celebrate, after which we discussed our immediate thoughts. The thoughts below are the general thoughts we had after watching, while we plan to do our in-depth analysis of the game rules at our next meeting.

= Ajibola
- This season is remarkably similar to Tipping Point, the 2021-22 VRC game challenge. Both Tipping Point and High Stakes utilized mobile goals that you could score rings onto to score points. Although there are some notable strategic differences. In Tipping Point, the only location you could score rings on were the mobile goals, and there was no possession limit for mobile goals, so teams would try to hoard as many of the mobile goals as possible. In High Stakes, due to the possession limit, that strategy is not directly applicable. However, I still think that an integral part of the game strategy will be having a mechanism to hold a mobile goal for an extended period of time to score rings on, similar to Tipping Point. To get to the mobile goals fast, a high speed drivetrain and good autonomous routine will be needed. Torque does not seem to be necessary for this game challenge, so most teams will likely have higher speed drivetrains than before.
- The end game for this season will be very interesting. The elevation aspect of the endgame is very similar to the elevation endgame in Over Under, so I suspect that elevation mechanisms prevalent in Over Under such as claws will be prevalent this season. What I find the most intriguing is that teams will have to decide between elevating and scoring mobile goals in the corners of the field for points. I predict that earlier on in the season, teams will refrain from elevating, but as the season goes on, more teams will elevate.
- Overall, my prediction of what a robot would need:
  - 450 RPM 2.75 inch drivetrain
  - 4-bar or similar high reaching mechanism to score rings on the high stake and to elevate at the end of the match.
  - Back claw with an intake going towards it to pick up a mobile goal and drop rings onto
  - As lightweight as possible to make elevation easier
  - Tracking wheels for more consistent autons

- Immediately, I noticed that this season's game takes a lot of inspiration from previous games, notably Round Up, Tipping Point, and Over Under. Luckily, I already have previous experience with building mechanisms to grab the mobile goals from Tipping Point. This game seems to build base rather than drive base which is different from Over Under.
- I predict that we would need a robot that could reach high enough to score on the highest stake. I really hope that a 4-bar would be competitive in the game. 
- Because they're rings, that would make stacking and collecting the rings very easy. Something I didn't like from Tipping Point was the obscure shape the rings had that made them awkward to pick up.
- What makes this game unique is the end game. There are two strategies, either descore as many points from the opposing alliance as possible or hang. I feel like the hands that were in Over Under Worlds will be very viable in this season to get a tier 3 hang. I also feel like we will witness teams scoring points at the very last second. I am curious which method is worth doing.
- I think the team should look into a clamp that could steal the goals away from the opposing team's robot. This would allow us to have control of the mobile goals without breaking the object possession limit. I think a pneumatic clamp would be good as it can serve as a clamp for mobile goals and for hanging. 

= Ishika
- The game High Stakes is the revamped version of an older game Round Up. Looking at the components of the new game there can be a lot of new and innovative designs to come up with. 
- My first thought as I saw the game reveal was that the best way to pick up the rings would probably be some type of claw mechanism that opens and allows you to pick up the rings. They would be in the shape and size of the rings making it much easier. This year there will be a lot of offensive fighting to get the portable goals into the negative or positive corners. This is something we need to keep in mind when building our bot. 
- During this game, there is also a climbing aspect with three levels that your robot can climb up to. I think the climbing mechanism will take some planning because there are certain regulations you need to follow.
- So far I do not have many ideas related to the climbing mechanism but the base of the idea will probably be inspired a lot from Over Under. Overall I think this game will be interesting because it will push a lot of strategic play and quick-thinking skills.

= Eric
- The game for next year (High Stakes) is a game with lots of complex factors that we will have to take in mind when constructing our robot.
- We will need to focus on knowing what we will do before we do it and remembering the trade-offs that we may have to make.
- This game will definitely use up all of our motors and many pneumatic components if we want to be versatile and efficient.
- We will also need to find new ways to make things so that we spend less time and create a higher quality product.
- We should explore all the possibilities we come up with to see what we can do and in what ways.

= Rory
- The new season's game, High Stakes, is going to require a lot of ingenuity. It will require a complicated climbing mechanism, a mechanism to pick up rings, and a good drivetrain. We will also need to plan what we are going to do before we do it to avoid people not knowing what's going on. We need to work on CAD more if we want to be more efficient with our time. We should think of all of the things we can do before we start so that we don't build something that isn't the best.

- The new season's game, High Stakes, will require a lot of ingenuity. We need a complicated climbing mechanism, a way to pick up rings, and a strong drivetrain. It's crucial to plan everything in advance to ensure everyone knows what's going on and stays coordinated. To be more efficient, we need to work more with CAD. By designing everything in CAD first, we can visualize and refine our ideas before construction. We should consider all possible strategies and solutions before we start building to ensure we create the best possible robot.
