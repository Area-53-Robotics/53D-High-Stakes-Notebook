= Overall
53D had a great season during High Stakes, managing to make it to the States championship and qualifying for the elimination matches as the 16th ranked team out of 56. The team has gained a wealth of knowledge about building strategies and how to assess build quality, which will be invaluable for the upcoming season.

#h(1em) As the programmer of the squad, I am proud of our program improvements over the season. We implemented various features, such as a Pre-Auton driver menu, joystick curving, an absolute position tracking system, and a PID movement & turning system for the autonomous phase. Next year, I plan to implement pure pursuit into our autonomous routes to create smooth and consistent turns. This would greatly expand our movement options in autonomous, allowing us to create more efficient routes than our competitors and stand out better to judges.

#h(1em) Overall, I am also proud of our team's skill acquisition throughout last season. We have improved in many aspects of robotics, such as planning, designing, budgeting, and communication. I am sure that this year will be no different, and I am confident that we can go even further up the VRC ladder this year compared to last year.

#h(1em) Next year, I would like to put a greater focus on research when designing. Researching could span from utilizing our experiences from previous seasons to observing what other teams do in tournament matches. Regardless, it would allow us to make informed decisions, ensuring the greatest amount of possible success.

#h(1em) I predict that the next challenge will be a possession game of some kind. VEX has established a cycle of having a shooting game (Turning Point, 2018-19 & Spin Up, 2022-23), followed by a stacking game (Tower Takeover, 2019-20 & Change Up, 2020-21), and ending with a possession game (Tipping Point, 2021-22). Although last season's challenge, Over Under (2023-24), wasn't a stacking game, I think that the yearly game pattern will still be maintained.

#h(1em) As someone who joined the team late, I am incredibly proud of how far the team has come. Every team member contributed immensely to the robot and our previous season performance. I am excited to be continuing on 53D and getting to witness, first hand, the growth of my team members. Going forward, I want to be a spearhead for the new incoming builders, as well as teaching my skills in order to secure the prosperity of the team's future.

#h(1em) This season, I want to place more emphasis on CAD or any other form of sharing ideas among teammates. Not only does this help promote effective collaboration but is good for the notebook as well. Something that we did wrong last season were the rushed and uncoordinated changes to the bot that really harmed us time-wise. I want to do better at managing the tasks.

#h(1em) I also want to learn how to document the robot better for this season. I have learned a lot of new skills about notebook documentation that I wish to implement in this notebook. Something that we didn't do was not take enough pictures of our building steps and materials. I hope to get the whole team to help with the notebook this year.

#h(1em) Something that we did right from last season that I want to keep for this season is our gantt charts. These gantt charts have been very helpful for planning ahead and making deadlines. I am very excited to continue working with 53D for this season!

#h(1em) I predict that the new game will have a shooting element. For the past two games, Spin Up and Over Under, there was a shooting mechanism where we had to throw a game element across the field. This aspect of the game encourages a diverse array of robots because there are multiple ways of throwing an object: catapults, punchers, kicker, and slingshots. Additionally, since the team has experience with building shooting mechanisms, having a game with a shooting mechanic will give us an early advantage.

#h(1em) Although this was my first year on 53D, I am very proud of how we did. Even though we encountered challenges, the team was able to adapt and overcome them. However, one of my biggest concerns is more coding time. We often came across issues where we didn't have enough time to complete an auton. If we can use tracking wheels then we can properly get a very good skill bot.

#h(1em) I predict that the new game will have a shooting mechanic. Most importantly, I think we will be seeing a game where we have to score an object with a lot of sides. To make the game more challenging, I predict that we will be working with obscure shapes. 


= Eric
#h(1em) I am very happy with how we did this season. I gained a lot of experience while being the builder on 53D. Even though we had our challenges, the team always worked together to solve any issue. I think going forward, we should pay more attention to the build quality. Firstly, we experience a lot of bending on our drivetrain which hinders our performance. We should also work on bracing our robot better.

#h(1em) My predictions for next season are that the next game will include elements of stacking and platforms. I predict this because, from my observations, I can see a pattern within the VEX games that each season tends to alternate aspects of stacking and shooting. 


= Rory
#h(1em) The team spent countless hours brainstorming our robot and I am happy that our hard work paid off. We've faced many setbacks but each obstacle made us a stronger team. Since this was my first year doing Vex Robotics, I've gained a lot of valuable insight. I think we should have more people contributing to the notebook as we saw that the notebook is an effective way to win awards and get to states. I hope we can get to worlds this season.

#h(1em) I have a few predictions. I think the game will include a shooting mechanic and involve scoring objects with many sides. These objects might come in unusual shapes to make the game more challenging.

#h(1em) The most important part of robotics is not winning, but sharing knowledge. Next year, I plan to CAD and design everything before starting construction and have the freshmen on the team build it using the CAD as instructions. This way, they can learn through trial and error while I guide them. My hope is that they will eventually teach others, passing on what they've learned.

#h(1em) I predict that next year's game will focus more on stacking and platforms. VEX often alternates between shooting games and stacking games, so I think stacking will be the main challenge next season.
