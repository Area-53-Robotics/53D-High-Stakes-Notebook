      - c. There is no minimum number of Rings required; if only one Ring is Scored on a Stake, then it is still considered Stake's Top Ring.

      The High Stakes rings are very similar to the Tipping Point #glossary-footnote[Tipping Point] rings, but with a few notable differences:
      + The High Stakes rings are flat, while the Tipping Point rings were bent.

      Therefore, it will be harder to make consistent intake mechanisms because the rings will be less workable.

      These differences will cause a few notable issues when building our robot:

There is also a single High Stake atop the vertical post nearest the audience side of the Field, at the 180 degree mark on a GPS strip.

      Similar to High Stakes, VRC Over Under #glossary-footnote[Over Under] also had an endgame elevation mechanic, but with a few key differences:
      + The High Stakes ladder has 3 elevation rungs, while the Over Under elevation bar had 1 rung.
      + There is only 1 ladder on the High Stakes field, while there was 1 elevation bar per alliance in Over Under.
      + Elevation scoring in Over Under had 10 scorable tiers, while High Stakes has 3 scorable tiers.
      + It was possible to balance on the mid-field barrier in Over Under, but there is no similar mechanic in High Stakes.

      These differences will cause a few notable effects in matches:
      + Because it is harder to elevate this year, less teams will create successful elevation mechanisms.
      + Out of the teams that do make elevation mechanisms, very few of them will get past level 1.
      + We will have to make decide during in-round endgames whether it is worth taking time to elevate to higher levels, or if it is better to score mobile goals in corners.

    - *Corner* #sym.dash.em One of four 12” x 12” locations in which Mobile Goals can be Placed. The Corners are bounded by the inner edges of the Field Perimeter and the outer edge of the associated white tape lines. The Corner is defined as the foam tile and tape line themselves; it is not a 3-dimensional volume.
      - *Negative Corner* #sym.dash.em A Corner of the field, designated by the “-” sign on the stickers applied to the top of the Field Perimeter.
      - *Positive Corner* #sym.dash.em A Corner of the field, designated by the “+” sign on the stickers applied to the top of the Field Perimeter.

      - a. The Mobile Goal's base is contacting the Corner (i.e., the Floor and/or white tape line).
      - b. It is “upright.” For the purposes of this definition, a Mobile Goal is considered “upright” if no contact is being made between its Stake (and/or any Rings on this Stake) and the Floor or Field Perimeter.
      - c. Contact with a Robot is irrelevant, as long as all other criteria are met

      The corner modifier mechanic in High Stakes is unlike anything we have experienced in previous VEX challenges. Due to how significantly the corner modifiers can affect final scores, we predict they will have a large impact on matches in the following ways:
      + During early and mid-season, when most robots don't have elevation capabilities, fights to score and descore mobile goals in corners will be a prominent part of the endgame.
      + During late season, when some robots have elevation capabilities, it will be important for alliances to strategize how they will elevate while also maximizing their score using the corners modifiers.

- *Autonomous Period* #sym.dash.em A 15 second-long time period during which Robots operate and react only to sensor inputs and pre-programmed commands
- *Autonomous Line* #sym.dash.em The pair of white tape lines that run across the field, and the space between those lines.
- #vex-rule[SG7] Don't cross the Autonomous Line. During the Autonomous Period, Robots may not contact foam tiles, Scoring Objects, or Field Elements which are on the opposing Alliance's side of the Autonomous Line.
- #vex-rule[SC2] Scoring of the Autonomous Bonus is evaluated immediately after the Autonomous Period ends (i.e., once all Scoring Objects, Field Elements, and Robots on the Field come to rest). 
  - a. Climb points and Corner modifiers are not included in the calculation of an Alliance's score for the purposes of determining the Autonomous Bonus.
  - b. If the Autonomous Period ends in a tie, including a zero-to-zero tie, each Alliance will receive an Autonomous Bonus of 3 points.
- #vex-rule[SC8] An Autonomous Win Point is awarded to any Alliance that ends the Autonomous Period with the following tasks completed, and that has not broken any rules during the Autonomous Period:
  - 1. At least 3 Scored Rings of the Alliance's color
  - 2. A minimum of 2 Stakes on the Alliance's side of the Autonomous Line with at least 1 Ring of the Alliance's color Scored
  - 3. Neither Robot contacting / breaking the plane of the Starting Line
  - 4. At least 1 Robot contacting the Ladder
  - Note: Autonomous Win Point criteria will be slightly modified for events that qualify directly to the World Championship. The modified criteria will be released on September 3, 2024.
