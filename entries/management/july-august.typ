Since the month of July is almost over, we decided to plan out our meetings for both July and August today.

= June Management Review
== June Time Management

We were able to complete our overall robot design cycle 4 days earlier than we initially planned, allowing us to get started early on the Drivetrain v1 design cycle. As a result, we are significantly ahead of our planned schedule.

== June Budget & Materials Management
None of the work we did in June involved building, so we did not spend any of our funds for materials.

= July & August Time Management
July & August make up the majority of the early season, so this will be the ideal time to solidify our robot ideas and complete the foundations of our robot.

The Minnesota signature event will occur during July, during which many of the best VEX teams will debut their early season robot designs. We expect this to be a great opportunity for us to re-evaluate our overall robot plans to make sure they will remain efficient and competitive compared to other robots.

Taking these factors into consideration, we created this gantt chart:
