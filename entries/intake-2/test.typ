The primary goal of testing the new intake is to evaluate how effectively it can manipulate rings. To ensure consistency and comparability, we plan to conduct the same series of tests that we performed on the first intake.

= Speed
== Background
The intake should be fast when intaking rings. A fast intake allows us to score onto the mobile goal and load rings into the ladybrown quickly. Since we did not change the intakeâ€™s RPM, we are not expecting a speed change compared to the first intake's test results.

== Hypothesis
The robot will score six rings onto the mobile goal stake in 30 seconds or faster.

    + Place six rings in a straight line in front of the robot, each a quarter inch apart.
    + Start the stopwatch.
    + Activate the intake while driving forward.
    + Stop the stopwatch after the last ring has been scored onto the stake.
    + Repeat steps 1-7 for a total of 5 trials.

  }
)

== Conclusion
We did not expect these results since we did not change the RPM of the intake. Because there was no jamming, the intake was able to fill the mobile goal faster. We are happy with the results.

= Jamming
== Background
During a match, intake jamming is extremely frustrating, as it prevents us from scoring and limits us to assisting our alliance partner by ramming game elements with the drivetrain. This slows down the pace of the game and makes it harder to win. Our previous intake experienced jamming between the first and second stage. We are confident that our new intake will be better.

== Hypothesis
The intake will jam after the fourth ring has been fed into it.

        ([5], 1, 4),
      )
    )
  })
]

== Conclusion
Since the first stage of the intake has not changed, we expected the intake to jam after four rings. What is interesting is that the intake was more consistent and performed better than the previous intake. Shortening the intake helped us reduce the drag that the ring had when transitioning between the two stages.

= Consistency
== Background
To maximize our chances of scoring points, it is crucial that the feeding of rings from the intake to the mobile goal is smooth and consistent. To assess this, we are testing how frequently the rings either miss or successfully score on the mobile goal stake.

== Hypothesis
The intake will properly score 5 or more out of 6 rings onto the mobile goal.

      )
    })
  }
)

== Conclusion
The smoother transition between the first two stages of the intake made the robot much more consistent at scoring rings onto the mobile goal. However, we wonder how effective this intake would be during real match play, as many factors, such as the angle at which the mobile goal is clamped and material stress, can reduce the effectiveness of our intake.
