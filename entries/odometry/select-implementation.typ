After brainstorming the autonomous implementation options, we needed to select one to use.

#decision-matrix-criteria[
  - Setup Intuitiveness - How easy the implementation method is to set up. A higher score means it is easier.
  - PID Robustness - How flexible the implementation method's PID movement is. A higher score means it is more flexible.
  - PID Implementation Time - The amount of time it takes to get the implementation method's PID working. A higher score means it takes less time.
  - Pure Pursuit Robustness - How flexible the implementation method's Pure Pursuit is. A higher score means it is more flexible.
  - Pure Pursuit Implementation Time - The amount of time it takes to get the implementation method's Pure Pursuit working. A higher score means it takes less time.

#admonition(type: "select", title: "Final Selection")[
  LemLib offers the greatest flexibility with autonomous movement using both PID and Pure Pursuit.
