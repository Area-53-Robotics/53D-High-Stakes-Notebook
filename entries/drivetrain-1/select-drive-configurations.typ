After brainstorming different drive configurations, we had to pick one to begin building. This will be a very important decision as it will determine what we can build in the future. As such, we identified as much criteria as possible to make an accurate judgement.

#decision-matrix-criteria[
  - Speed - The maximum speed of the drivetrain configuration.
  - Acceleration - How fast the drivetrain accelerates.
  - Turning - The smoothness of the turns made with the drivetrain configuration.
  - Force - How much force the drivetrain configuration can generate.
  - Compactness - How little space the drivetrain configuration takes up.
  - Omni-Directionality - The ability of the drivetrain configuration to move in multiple directions.
  - Ease of Programming - How easy the drivetrain configuration is to program.
  - Ease of Driving - How easy the drivetrain configuration is to drive.

#admonition(type: "select", title: "Final Selection")[
  A tank drive configuration meets the most of the criteria we identified for the what we need in a drive configuration. In addition, we are the most familiar with tank drive, and it allows us to get the most speed and acceleration without sacrificing torque. The flexibility it offers will be useful later in the season when we likely have to rebuild subsystems.
