The last important factor that goes into a drivetrain is the gear ratio that is used. Gear ratios affect the torque and speed output of a subsystem, and is a critical part of drivetrain creation. We used a publicly available spreadsheet #footnote[#link("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RSoLv3tnpiCgFyHb0QayxK-42r9MgVRD_4QQmeFM618/edit#gid=0")] to help us collect the data needed for each gear ratio.

  wheel-size: 2.75,
  gear-ratio: "36:48",
  simplified-ratio: "3:4",
  rpm: 450,
  speed: 64.8,
  pros: [
    - *Speed-Torque Balance* - Gearing down from 600 RPM to 450 RPM trades speed (some of which is unnecessary anyways) to create an effective balance between speed and torque.
    - *Control* - Gearing down the RPM produces better control, as the drivetrain is not turning as fast.
  ],
  cons: [
    - *Speed* - Due to having the lowest RPM and smallest wheels out of the brainstormed options, this option is the slowest.
    - *Limited Traction* - Limited traction due to the smaller wheels.
  ],
  notes: [
    - This is the same gear ratio that we ran last year

  image: image("brainstorm-gear-ratio/600 RPM 2.75 inch.excalidraw.svg"),

  wheel-size: 2.75,
  gear-ratio: "60:60",
  simplified-ratio: "1:1",
  rpm: 600,
  speed: 86.394,
  pros: [
    - *Speed* - Direct drive allows for high speed and acceleration, creating quick movements.
    - *Force* - Direct drive leads to less mechanical energy loss between gears.
  ],
  cons: [
    - *Load Capacity* - Limited torque causes limited load capacity.
    - *Skidding* - The high speed of the drivetrain makes it more prone to slipping.
  ],
  notes: [
    - Better for speed than control

  wheel-size: 3.25,
  gear-ratio: "36:48",
  simplified-ratio: "3:4",
  rpm: 450,
  speed: 76.6,
  pros: [
    - *Speed-Torque Balance* - Gearing down from 600 RPM to 450 RPM and using bigger wheels creates an ideal balance between speed and torque.
    - *Traction* - More traction than the other gear ratios because of the bigger wheels.
  ],
  cons: [
    - *Complexity* - This gear ratio requires gearing downwards and using bigger wheels, which can be hard to fit into a drivetrain half.
  ],
  notes: [
    - 3.25” wheels allow for 3 hole wide drive halves
