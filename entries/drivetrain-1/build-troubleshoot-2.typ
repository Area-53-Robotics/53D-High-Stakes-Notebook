We found a motor issue in the drivetrain, which we repaired by using a new gearbox and remounting the motor.

== Delegation
#delegation(
  recurring: [
    - *Inventory* (Collecting materials): Eric, Makhi
    - *Manufacturing* (cutting pieces to size, cleaning sharp edges): Anders, Rory, Eric
    - *Oversight & Quality Control*: Makhi
    - *Initial Testing*: Makhi
  ],
  today: [
    - Troubleshoot the drivetrain: Eric
    - Clean and lubricate the drivetrain's wheels: Eric
  ]
)

== Build Process

      === Materials
      - Motor
      - Blue Gearbox
      - Zipties
      - Rubber Band
      - The rest of the materials can be found in the toolbox.
    ],
    [
      === Assembly
      - Replaced the gearbox of the loose motor.
        - One of the inserts had a broken thread. This caused the motor to loosen over time.
      - Tightened the motor mounting piece.
      - Quick-swapped the motor using zipties and a rubber band.
      - #text(red)[Problem:] There was a crack in the ladybrown C-channel.
      - #text(green)[Solution:] We added a ziptie that was perpendicular to the axis of bending. This reduces the amount of stress on the ladybrown.
    ],
    [
      === Troubleshooting
      - Tested the drivetrain for friction to see if it was working after repairs.
