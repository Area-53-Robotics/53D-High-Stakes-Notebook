We did a lot of troubleshooting with different parts of the ring rush mechanism, including modifying the length of the screws, locating pneumatic leaks, and ensuring sufficient clearance between different parts.

      === Assembly
      - Added two 1/4-inch screws on the collar of our ring rush mechanism.
        - On the 2x2x1 C-channel, there are collars that spin on a screw joint.
      - #text(red)[Problem:] When the ring rush mechanism activates, the screws get stuck. This is due to Newtonâ€™s first law, which states that an object in motion will continue moving at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
        - #text(green)[Solution:] We added zipties that prevent the screws from going too far. The screws will bounce off the zipties.


    ],
    [
      === Troubleshooting
      - The screws were too short, so we switched them for the longest ones (2.5 inch).
      - There was a slight pneumatic leakage, but its not fixed.
      - We had to space them out by 1/4 inch.
