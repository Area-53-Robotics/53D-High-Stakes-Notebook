// Throughout the season, we have observed a large variety of elevation options, with each of them varying greatly in how they are constructed. We created a pros and cons list for each of them to organize our collective thoughts.

#pro-con(
  name: "Ajibola",
  image: image("./brainstorm/---.svg"),
  pros: [
    - Center of gravity is closer to the center of the robot due to the bulky 4-bar and intake
    - Stable
    - Very defensive
  ],
  cons: [
    - Climbing would be very inefficient, as it would tilt backwards
    - Slow drivetrain
    - Unsupported parts
  ],
  notes: [
    - 4-bar for climbing and putting rings on the high stake with the clamp
    - Back clamp for carrying a mogo
    - Intake 
  ],
)
