= Overview
The Sugar Rush Signature Event is a high-level competition VEX Robotics tournament designed to challenge teams to innovate and perform at their best. Success in this event can also help teams qualify for the VEX Robotics World Championship. The winners were 5956B and 11777C.

    - *Intake*: Their intake has two stages, much like ours, with a 400 RPM first stage and a 600 RPM second stage. Their first stage has a cover made of lexan, and instead of one big ramp from the first to the second stage, they use two separate pieces of lexan. They use 3 flex wheels on their first stage.
    - *Climb*: Their climbing mechanism allows them to climb to the first level of the ladder. It is made of 1x1 angles with standoffs on the ends. It pops up along with their wall stake mechanism.

    - *Wall Stake Mechanism*: They have a 66 RPM wall stake mechanism that takes rings directly from the intake and friction fits it in between the two arms. It then easily slides off onto the wall stakes.

= Final Observations
1. We saw a lot of ladybrowns that were capable of rotating 180 degrees. These types of ladybrowns were capable of flipping mobile goals over and descoring rings from mobile goals. We are considering rebuilding our ladybrown so that it has a 180 degree range of rotation.
2. We saw that a lot of robots had an auton that can score on the neutral wall stake. The ability to score on the wall stakes during auton would give us a significant advantage because then the enemy team would need to focus on placing their own color rings on the wall stakes. This gives them less time to focus on securing positive corners.
3. We did not see any significant hang mechanisms. Some teams ran a passive hang that is attached to their ladybrown. It looks like going for stage two and three are not worth the time invested to reach there.
